### Observations and Insights
1. The four most promising treatment regimens were Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Of these regimens, Capomulin and Ramicane showed to have the lowest final tumor volume.
2. The tumor volume for subject s185 was nearly halved as it received the Capumulin treatment regimen.
3. There appears to be a strong positive correlation between the weight of a mouse and its tumor size. This means that mice who have a higher tumor volume suggest that they are likely to also have a higher weight.
